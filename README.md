# Q-learning
In this project I was the leader of a 5-member project team, 
and as a developer in the autonomous learning part of the AI. 
The goal of the team was to create an AI that applied Machine Learning 
to automate its learning. For the development of this AI we used the 
Python language and libraries such as Numpy, Enum and Random. 
The main objective of the AI was to find the most effective way out of the "labyrinth", 
rewarding it every time it found this exit. This maze was repeated as many times as 
the program was asked to find the most efficient path. The project was completed in only 1 month.
